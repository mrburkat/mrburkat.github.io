		<h2>How Puerto Rico Came to Be:</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The indigenous people of the island we call Puerto Rico lived off of tropical crops and seafood, and made small chief-led villages.</li><br>
		  <li>Until 1493, when Christopher Columbus claimed the land for Spain.</li><br>
		  <li>The island was mostly left alone until Ponce de Le√≥n got permission to explore the island. He saw promise in the harbors, so he founded Caparra, and Puerto Rico's first town, San Juan.</li><br>
		  <li>Later, the natives, having lost respect for the Spanish, led a rebellion. Its success was only shortterm, and the Spanish brought slaves for gold mines. When little gold was found, those who stayed made sugarcane and ginger plantations.</li><br>
		  <li>In the later 16th century, Spain converted San Juan into a military outpost. </li><br>
		  <li>After a while, Spain only had a few territories left in the western hemisphere, including Puerto Rico.</li><br>
		  <li>But after the Spanish-American war, America won the territory.</li><br>
		  
		</ul>
