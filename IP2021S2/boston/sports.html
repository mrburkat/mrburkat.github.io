		<h1>Boston Sports Teams</h1>
		  <h3>Boston Celtics</h3>
		  <img src="../celtics.jpeg"
		  height = "150"
		  width = "138">
		  <li>The Boston Celtics are my favorite sports team of all time and for many different reasons. Not only are they a team with so much history and background but currently they have a bunch of young stars that can get good and be powerhouses in the NBA.</li>
		  <li>They have 17 NBA Championship Wins and are tied with the Lakers for the most Championship wins in the NBA. They have 36 players currently in the Hall of Fame as well as 6 coaches.</li>
		  <li>They have retired 22 numbers and when you retire a number that means that no future player is allowed to use the number. That is such an honor for an NBA player and it really immortalizes you because you know no one else can use that number.</li>
