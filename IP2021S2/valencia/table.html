		<h1>Valencia's Weather</h1>
		<p>Here in Valencia we have amazing weather. In the summer and srping we have the most perfect sun and weather for a nice tan beach and or pool, and other outside activities. While at night it cools off enough to be able to go out and relax.</p>
		<p>Winter and fall has nice cool weather. You can go outside and enjoy the cool weather without having to sweat so much from the sun beaming down on you.</p>
