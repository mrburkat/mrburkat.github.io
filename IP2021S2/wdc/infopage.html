        <h2>Information on Monuments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Washington Monument as it currently exists is actually a massive failure in comparison to the ambitious original design, which had called for a series of columns and statues of George Washington and 30 other figures from the Revolutionary War.</li>
          <br><li>At 555 feet, the obelisk, known as the Washington Monument, remains the tallest object in DC.</li>
	         <br><li>The construction of the Capitol was the first reality competition show. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson (then Secretary of State) created a contest in which the winning architectural designer would get a whopping $500. They didn’t like any of the 17 submitted designs and ended up accepting a bid that came in after the deadline from a Scottish doctor named William Thornton.</li>
	         <br><li>The Lincoln Memorial is where Martin Luther King Jr. made his “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963.</li>

        <h2>Information on the Washington Commanders</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Redskins play in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL) and have won two NFL championships (1937 and 1942) and three Super Bowls (1983, 1988, and 1992).</li>
          <br><li>The Redskins also have some of the most passionate fans in professional football; since 1967 the team has sold out every season, the longest string of sold-out games in the NFL.</li>
          <br><li>In 1999 the Redskins, owned outright since 1985 by the flamboyant Jack Kent Cooke, were purchased by billionaire Daniel Snyder, whose first decade of ownership was marked by splashy free-agent acquisitions, as well as a four-year return to the sidelines by Gibbs beginning in 2004, but few winning seasons. B</li>
          <br><li>The franchise’s nickname was the subject of much debate for decades—protesters believed that the term was a racial slur that was offensive to Native Americans, but supporters argued that the name reflected pride in the team’s heritage</li>
