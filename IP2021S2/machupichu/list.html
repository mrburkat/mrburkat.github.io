		<h2>500 years of History...</h2>
		<p>The History of Machu Picchu can be split into 3 parts: </p>
		
		<ol>
		  <li>Time as a royal estate (1438-1518)</li>
		  <li>European expeditions after rediscovery (1867-1964)</li>
		  <li>Modern preservation (1981-Present)</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Machu Picchu under the Incan Empire</h3>
  		<p>Scholars, such as Professor of Anthropology at Yale University<a href="https://anthropology.yale.edu/people/richard-l-burger"> Richard L. Burger</a>, believe that construction of Machu Picchu began under the rule of Inca leader <i>Pachacutec</i> (c. 1420AD), as a <b>royal estate</b>. Around 750 people lived there at a time, mostly support staff known as <i>yanaconas</i>. <b>Agriculture</b> in Machu Picchu was done on hundreds of man-made terraces, considered to be works of engineering genius! These terraces were built to ensure drainage and soil fertility, all while protecting the mountain from erosion and landslides. Although Machu Picchu was a <q>royal</q> estate, it was not generationally passed down. Rather, the site was abandoned after about 80 years of use with the conquest of the <b>Spanish</b>.</p>
