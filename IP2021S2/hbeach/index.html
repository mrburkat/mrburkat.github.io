		<h2 class="center">WELCOME TO SURF CITY, USA!</h2>
		<p class="center">Huntington Beach is one of the most known beaches in all of Orange County. Along the coastline of HB, there are many activities and events throughout the year. Plan your visit with West Side Beaches now and enjoy the one of a kind restuarants, shops, and more!</p>
		<h2 class="center">HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF HUNTINGTON</h2>
	<p class="center">The HB Historical Society strives to preserve our city's historic sites and to protect and promote the story of our past. From historic tours to educational events the communities partners together to make history come to life. One of the best ways to keep history alive in our community is to visit the remaining historic sites and attractions we have left. Come by the Newland House Museum for a tour of the home of some of Huntington Beach's first residents or come to our many free historical events throughout the year including Southern California's largest Civil War reenactment, HB Civil War Days, hosted by the HB Historical Society on Labor Day Weekend in Central Park</p>
